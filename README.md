# Contract Analysis Tool

üåê **Live Application**: [https://legal-hack.vercel.app/compare](https://legal-hack.vercel.app/compare)

A powerful AI-powered tool for analyzing and comparing legal contracts. This application helps users without legal expertise make informed decisions by identifying key clauses, potential conflicts, and risks in contracts.

## Process Flow

The application follows a two-phase process:

1. **Initial Processing (Upload Contract)**
   - Contract is uploaded and stored in PocketBase
   - Document is processed by LangChain
   - OpenAI extracts clauses and generates embeddings
   - Clauses are stored in PocketBase
   - Embeddings are stored in Qdrant for future reference

2. **Analysis & Recommendations (Compare Contracts)**
   - Core clauses are extracted from the new contract
   - Similar clauses are searched in the vector database
   - OpenAI analyzes differences and generates recommendations
   - User receives classified clauses with actionable insights
